            So, what did we learn? Well, overall, Donald Trump's Twitter feed is overwhelmingly positive. His most favourited / most infamous tweet, however, was considered neutral:
        </p>
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
            <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me "old," when I would NEVER call him "short and fat?" Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen!</p>&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/929511061954297857?lang=en">Nov 12, 2017</a>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="prose">
            And maybe someday we will know exactly why Donald Trump tweets the way that he does, and what that means for the future of communication between politicians and the world.

            <p class="small">Data</p>
        </div>
        <p class="prose"> Tweet data comes from the <a href="//www.trumptwitterarchive.com"><font color="212683">The Trump Twitter Archive</font></a>. The data was collected on the 13th of March, 2019, and spans the range 23/01/17 to 12/03/19. I filtered out tweets that began with a quote or "RT" so that I would keep only tweets containing Trump's own language.
